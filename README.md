# md-trajectools

A lightweight collection of Python scripts for post-processing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories.  
This is **not a Python package**. Instead, this repository provides **ready-to-use analysis scripts** that can be:

- Run directly from the command line
- Copied into your own Jupyter notebooks or workflows
- Modified freely to suit your system and analysis needs

---

## üîç What's Included

- `msd.py`: Mean Square Displacement
- `rdf.py`: Radial Distribution Function
- `residence_time.py`: Residence time analysis
- `utils.py`: Shared utility functions
- `examples/`: Usage demos and templates

More to be updated...

## üí° Use Philosophy
This project follows a simple principle: "Transparent, editable, and reusable". You are encouraged to:
- Run these scripts as-is
- Copy-paste functions into your own workflow
- Modify for your specific MD system or output format

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/md-trajectools.git
cd md-trajectools

# Install required dependencies
