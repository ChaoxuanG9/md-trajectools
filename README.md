# md-trajectools

A lightweight collection of Python scripts for post-processing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories.  
This is **not a Python package**. Instead, this repository provides **ready-to-use analysis scripts** that can be:

- Run directly from the command line
- Copied into your own Jupyter notebooks or workflows
- Modified freely to suit your system and analysis needs

---

## üîç What's Included

- `msd.py`: Mean Square Displacement
- `rdf.py`: Radial Distribution Function
- `residence_time.py`: Residence time analysis
- `utils.py`: Shared utility functions
- `examples/`: Usage demos and templates

More to be updated...

## üß∞ Key Features

- Minimal dependencies: easy to run in most MD Python environments
- Works with any trajectory readable by [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)
- Scripts can be used standalone from the command line
- Functions can also be reused or modified inside Jupyter notebooks
- Clean, commented code with built-in argument parsing and output handling


## üí° Use Philosophy
This project follows a simple principle: "Transparent, editable, and reusable". You are encouraged to:
- Run these scripts as-is
- Copy-paste functions into your own workflow
- Modify for your specific MD system or output format
-
